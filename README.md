## Chatter Alert John Boards ##

<b>Challenge:</b> Law enforcement and their allies working to end illegal commercial sexual exploitation do not yet know what tactics are most effective in disrupting the trade. One indicator of success is when a tactic is highlighted on the “john boards” (review sites) alerting pimps, traffickers and prospective buyers. This project will help which tactics are effective or when a tactic has been exposed and will no longer be effective.

<b>Project:</b> Similar to a Google Media Alert System, this project would develop a tool that would search frequently scraped data from “john board” sites for a pre-described list of keywords, and automate notifications to practitioners and law enforcement officers when their activities or stakeholders are being referenced. Data collection could be searchable by keyword, geographic area, or by commentator username.
